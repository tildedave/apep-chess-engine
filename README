This is a chess engine that I programmed in grad school (C++).  I'm sure a lot of the code is 
bad/could have been done better.  Looking at the code I couldn't find the tests, which is a good 
sign that I messed something up.

I did most of the search stuff and stopped active development when the engine needed to 
understand the "goodness" of a board.

Minor points:
	* Code is pretty bad.

	* I got a lot out of looking at crafty source code (hopefully
          the resemblence is not too obvious).

	* There are some epd chess board files that I used to test
          this engine that I have not included in this repo as they
          are not open source.

	* src/apep -perft performs 6-level perft.  

	* src/apep -dotests runs board tests (others are broken)

	* apep supports the Winboard Protocol v1
          http://home.hccnet.nl/h.g.muller/engine-intf.html, v2 was
          not out when I was developing apep!
