This is a chess engine that I programmed in grad school (C++).  I'm sure a lot of the code is 
bad/could have been done better.  Looking at the code I couldn't find the tests, which is a good 
sign that I messed something up.

I did most of the search stuff and stopped active development when the engine needed to 
understand the "goodness" of a board.

I got a lot out of looking at crafty source code (hopefully the resemblence is not too obvious).
